# Airline-Reservation-System-OOPS-
"I developed an airline reservation system in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The system provides key functionalities such as flight search, reservations, and cancellations. The system interacts with a MySQL database to manage flight and user data and dynamically handles seat availability."
